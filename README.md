# Volunteer Hub

# Problem Statement

The current system only allows for Hackers and Mentors, where both of these positions are software engineering focused. We still want to encourage all people, regardless of their background to volunteer their time to help us. We need you to build something into our ohack.dev platform that would allow for us to engage with volunteers who are looking to support us. The ultimate goal is to collect some information about what they are looking for, onboard them into Slack, and give them autonomy to accomplish goals.

# Our Solution

For each project, volunteers should be able to fill out a form specifically tailored to that project. This will allow the organization to gather important information about the volunteers and their availability, as well as any relevant skills or experience they may have. Upon completing the form, volunteers should be redirected to the appropriate slack channel for further instructions and information. In addition to project-specific forms, there should also be a page dedicated to general volunteer opportunities. This page should provide potential volunteers with information about the tasks involved and allow them to sign up to be notified of upcoming opportunities. By setting up these forms and pages, organizations can effectively manage and coordinate their volunteer workforce and ensure that volunteers have access to the information and support they need.
